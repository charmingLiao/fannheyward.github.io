> So earlier today we stopped censoring our search services—Google Search, Google News, and Google Images—on Google.cn. Users visiting [Google.cn][googlecn] are now being redirected to [Google.com.hk][googlehk], where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong.

I love Google.
