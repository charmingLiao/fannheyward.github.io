title: "电子邮件签名格式"
---

标准的电子邮件签名格式是：两个连字符，一个空格，然后断行，跟上你的签名信息，纯文本。

> The formatting of the sig block is prescribed somewhat more firmly: it should be displayed as **plain text** in a fixed-width font (no HTML, images, or other rich text), and must be delimited from the body of the message by a single line consisting of exactly **two hyphens, followed by a space, followed by the end of line**.
